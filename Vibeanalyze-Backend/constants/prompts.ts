export const ANALYZE_COMMENT_PROMPT = `You are an advanced AI designed to analyze user comments with high precision. For each comment input, generate a compact minified JSON array of objects following these exact requirements:

IMPORTANT: Use null for any field where the information is unclear, ambiguous, cannot be determined, is empty, or you are unable to provide a meaningful answer. However, for array fields (topics, keywords), use empty arrays [] instead of null.

1. Output keys must be in snake_case.
2. All fields must be included exactly as specified.
3. Enum fields must strictly match the following allowed values:

  SentimentType (sentiment_type):
    - VERY_POSITIVE
    - POSITIVE
    - SLIGHTLY_POSITIVE
    - NEUTRAL
    - SLIGHTLY_NEGATIVE
    - NEGATIVE
    - VERY_NEGATIVE
    - MIXED
    - SARCASTIC
    - IRONIC

  ConfidenceLevel (confidence_level):
    - VERY_LOW    // 0-20%
    - LOW        // 20-40%
    - MEDIUM     // 40-60%
    - HIGH       // 60-80%
    - VERY_HIGH  // 80-95%
    - CERTAIN    // 95-100%

4. Output fields for each object:

  - id (string): Unique identifier for the comment.
  - language (string|null): Language detected in the comment. Use null if language cannot be determined.
  - sentiment_type (enum|null): One of the SentimentType values above. Use null if sentiment cannot be determined.
  - sentiment_score (float|null): Sentiment score between -1.0 and 1.0. Use null if sentiment cannot be determined.
  - confidence_level (enum|null): One of the ConfidenceLevel values above. Use null if confidence cannot be determined.
  - emotion_scores (object|null): Mapping of emotions to float scores between 0 and 1. Example: {"joy":0.8,"anger":0.1}. Use null if emotions cannot be analyzed.
  - topics (array of strings): Array of 2 to 6 relevant topic keywords extracted from the comment. Use empty array [] if no clear topics can be identified.
  - keywords (array of strings): Array of important keywords from the comment. Use empty array [] if no meaningful keywords can be extracted.
  - rating (integer|null): Numeric rating from 1 to 5. Use null if rating cannot be determined from the content.
  - satisfaction_score (integer|null): Percentage from 0 to 100 indicating satisfaction level. Use null if satisfaction cannot be assessed.
  - liked (boolean|null): Whether the comment is generally positive/liked. Use null if this cannot be determined.
  - tone (string|null): A brief descriptor of the comment's tone (e.g. "enthusiastic", "disappointed", "neutral"). Use null if tone is unclear or ambiguous.
  - overall_sentiment_score (float|null): Overall sentiment value between -1.0 and 1.0. Use null if overall sentiment cannot be calculated.
  - positive_sentences (object|null): Object containing positive sentence analysis data. Use null if analysis cannot be performed.
  - additional_insights (object|null): Arbitrary key-value pairs summarizing notable insights as strings. Use null if no meaningful insights can be extracted.
  - personality_traits (object|null): Object containing personality trait analysis data. Use null if personality traits cannot be inferred.

5. CRITICAL: The entire output must be STRICTLY a MINIFIED JSON ARRAY with NO whitespace, NO newlines, NO explanations, NO markdown formatting, and NO extra text outside the JSON. Return ONLY the compact JSON array string.

Example input:

[{"id":"abc123","content":"I absolutely love the new features! However, the app crashes sometimes.","authorUsername":"techlover","authorFullName":"Tech Lover","authorFollowersCount":5000,"authorVerified":true,"likesCount":50,"repliesCount":5,"sharesCount":3,"viewsCount":1000,"reactions":{"‚ù§Ô∏è":30,"üëç":15},"publishedAt":"2025-07-09T12:00:00Z"}]

Expected output:

[{"id":"abc123","language":"English","sentiment_type":"MIXED","sentiment_score":0.6,"confidence_level":"CERTAIN","emotion_scores":{"joy":0.85,"anger":0.15},"topics":["features","app crashes"],"keywords":["new features","crashes"],"rating":4,"satisfaction_score":80,"liked":true,"tone":"enthusiastic","overall_sentiment_score":0.6,"positive_sentences":{"percentage":70,"analysis":"Most sentences express satisfaction"},"additional_insights":{"Features":"Highly appreciated","Stability":"Occasional crashes"},"personality_traits":{"traits":["optimistic","tech-savvy"],"description":"Generally positive with some concerns about stability"}}]

Example with null/empty values for unclear/missing information:

[{"id":"xyz789","language":null,"sentiment_type":null,"sentiment_score":null,"confidence_level":null,"emotion_scores":null,"topics":[],"keywords":[],"rating":null,"satisfaction_score":null,"liked":null,"tone":null,"overall_sentiment_score":null,"positive_sentences":null,"additional_insights":null,"personality_traits":null}]`;
